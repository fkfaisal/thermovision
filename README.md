# FeverDetector

Detect people who have fevers with FLIR Lepton + PureThermal Smart I/O Module on Linux or Mac
All these files are copied from following git:
https://github.com/MakeHub-tw/FeverDetector

## Hardware requirements

- FLIR Lepton 2.5 or 3.5
- PureThermal 1/2/Mini
- A USB cord with appropriate length

### Linux Platforms

- PC/NB running with Debian/Ubuntu distributions.
- Raspbian (tested) on Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ or above.

__NOTE__ Linux (< 4.0) + V4L (and OpenCV)

Linux Kernel versions less than 4.0 don't match the UVC format UVC_GUID_FORMAT_BGR3 with V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGR24. Applications that use libv4l and depend on the BGR24 format (such as the VideoCapture module of OpenCV) will not be able to use this format. Instead, they will use software scaling to convert RGB565 into RGB24/BRG24, at a loss in color resolution and with expense to CPU.

### MacOS

If you are using Mac, make sure that homebrew is installed.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this respository by `git clone https://github.com/MakeHub-tw/FeverDetector.git`
2. Execute `setup_linux.sh` to set up libraries and dependencies, or `setup_macos.sh` if you are using a Mac.
3. Execute `setup_python.sh` to build the execution environment. Or optionally, you can setup your own `virtualenv` first.
4. Go to `src` folder, and launch the application by `python3 FeverDetector.py` or `./FeverDetector.py`
5. Click `Start IR Camera Feed` to process the camera stream.
